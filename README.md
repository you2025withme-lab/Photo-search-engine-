# 📸 Photo Search Engine

**Photo Search Engine** is a simple and fast web app that allows users to upload any image  
and automatically opens a Google search page for that image — to find visually similar images or websites containing it.

The website is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **no backend server required**,  
making it lightweight, secure, and easily deployable on free hosting platforms such as **Netlify** or **GitHub Pages**.
